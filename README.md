###bamazonCustomer.js Overview

The bamazonCustomer.js file will allow the user to view all of the items currently listed in the 'bamazon' store. The app will then:

    Prompt users with two messages.

   * The first should ask them the ID of the product they would like to buy.
   * The second message should ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.

When the user selects the product and how many they would like to purchase, the CLI will print the total and will update the database with the new stock levels.
